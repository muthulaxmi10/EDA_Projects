🚦 Road Accident Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a road accident dataset containing 12,000+ records.
The objective is to understand accident patterns, severity distribution, and contributing factors using Python data analysis and visualization libraries.

EDA helps in identifying trends, data quality issues, and meaningful insights before building any predictive model.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key features:

Time & Day of accident

Driver details (age band, sex, education, experience)

Vehicle information (type, ownership, service years, defects)

Road & environment conditions (surface, weather, light, junctions)

Accident details (type of collision, cause, severity)

Casualty information (number, age band, severity)

Total Records: 12,316
Total Columns: 32

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔍 EDA Steps Performed
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

Loaded dataset using pandas

Checked shape, column names, data types

Displayed sample records

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Standardized text columns (e.g., day_of_week)

Handled missing values

Removed duplicate records

Identified irrelevant/unnecessary columns

3️⃣ Missing Value Analysis

Counted missing values per column

Decided whether to fill or keep missing data based on context

4️⃣ Outlier Detection (Observed, Not Removed)

Used IQR method to detect outliers

Outliers were not removed as accident data naturally contains extreme values

Outliers were reported for analysis only

5️⃣ Univariate Analysis

Accident severity distribution

Weather conditions

Road surface conditions

Light conditions

Time-based accident trends

6️⃣ Bivariate Analysis

Accident severity vs weather condition

Accident severity vs light condition

Number of vehicles vs number of casualties

7️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Heatmap for numeric variables

Observed weak positive correlation between:

Number of vehicles involved

Number of casualties

8️⃣ Visualizations

Bar charts

Count plots

Pie charts

Heatmap

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📊 Key Insights

Most accidents result in slight injuries

Accidents occur more frequently in daylight conditions

Dry road conditions show higher accident frequency

Higher number of vehicles involved slightly increases casualties

Weather and road conditions significantly influence accident severity

🚀 Conclusion

This EDA project demonstrates how to:

Clean and prepare real-world accident data

Identify patterns and relationships

Generate meaningful visual insights

Make data-driven observations without modeling

This analysis can help authorities improve road safety measures and accident prevention strategies.
