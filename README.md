📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset to understand customer behavior and identify the key factors that contribute to churn. The analysis helps in discovering patterns, trends, and insights that can support better customer retention strategies.

🎯 Objective

To analyze customer demographics, services, and contract details

To identify factors influencing customer churn

To visualize churn patterns using Python libraries

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Google Colab Notebook

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level information including:

Demographics (gender, senior citizen status)

Services subscribed (internet, phone, streaming services, tech support)

Contract details (contract type, tenure)

Target variable: Churn

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Count plots, histograms, pie charts, and stacked bar charts

Churn analysis by:

Gender

Senior citizen status

Contract type

Tenure

Internet and additional services

📈 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts show higher churn

Longer tenure customers are less likely to churn

Certain internet and add-on services influence churn behavior

Churn patterns differ across senior citizens vs non-senior citizens

Service combinations play an important role in customer retention

📊 Visualizations Included

Churn distribution count plots

Churn percentage pie charts

Stacked bar charts for churn comparison

Histogram showing tenure distribution by churn

Service-wise churn analysis using multiple subplots

🚀 Conclusion

The EDA reveals that contract type, tenure, and service usage are strong indicators of customer churn. These insights can help businesses design targeted strategies to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
